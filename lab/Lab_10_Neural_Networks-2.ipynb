That’s what you would expect when running optimization—the quantity you’re trying to minimize should be less with every iteration. But that isn’t the case for the validation loss and accuracy: they seem to peak at the fourth epoch. This is an example of what we warned against earlier: a model that performs better on the training data isn’t necessarily a model that will do better on data it has never seen before. In precise terms, what you’re seeing is overfitting: after the fourth epoch, you’re overoptimizing on the training data, and you end up learning representations that are specific to the training data and don’t generalize to data outside of the training set.\n",
